<p class="meta">5 January 2024 - New York, NY</p>

In late July, I headed down to Costa Rica for a week of surfing. 

The summer lull in New York was getting to me; 1-2ft surf was forecasted for weeks. Weekend beach-drinking and boogie-boarding usually keep me satisfied until the first fall swells, but this year I was itching. 

Surfers are accustomed to the itch. To an external observer, it looks somewhat normal; maybe a few too many Surfline checks and a YouTube recommended page filled with surf vids. In reality, it's an all-consuming obsession. Free minutes are spent thinking of the ocean. You lay in bed reliving that one epic session from two years ago. Your heart pumps anticipating the next big day.

This itch was a strong one. I saw a week-long window where work would be slow, so I decided to send a trip. Where to, though? The criteria were straightforward:
- Good waves forecasted
- Warm water
- Cheap flights

Northern Costa Rica fit the bill well. The charts showed a multi-week long run of swell, and the flights were cheaper than neighboring Nicaragua. I had also been to Costa Rica a few times before (the southern region); the country is beautiful, the people are incredible, and tourism infrastructure is established. 

Looking for some company, I reached out to my usual surf trip members. None were able to mobilize with a week's notice. A moment of doubt (I had never traveled alone) was quickly neutralized by the itch. Soon, I was at the JetBlue JFK terminal with a backpack and a surfboard bag.

In twelve hours I arrived at Playa Guiones, a beach break known for its consistency, gentle takeoffs, and expansive lineup. During the Costa Rican wet season (May-Nov), Guiones is battered with long-period, sizable Pacific south swell. Naturally, the place is popular among locals and visitors alike.

For me, an average surfer from the lackluster East Coast, surf trips are when I get to expand my comfort zone in the ocean. Getting reps in consistent, powerful surf is the only way to progress. As it goes, though, the first paddle out is rough. No amount of urban exercise can prepare you for getting worked by a Pacific set. I reached the lineup that morning huffing and puffing, glad to still be on my board.

I'll never forget my first wave at Guiones. A deep turquoise wall approaches: steady, uninterrupted. The three surfers around me aren't paddling for position. I dig in, start matching the wave's speed. In a blur, I'm up (wow, the takeoffs are super gentle), pumping down the line, staying pretty high on the face. I watch the wave bend around the sandbar in front of me, providing me more speed and one final section. I hear a "woo!" from the lineup as I kick out.

Life for the next six days was simple. My schedule was determined by the sun, tide, and wind. I would surf the morning high tide, refuel and rest during the afternoon onshore winds, surf until sunset (conditions permitting), eat and sleep. Though I met some surfers -- locals and travelers -- most of these hours were spent in solitude. Existing in this way, even for a short period of time, felt natural.

I went to a small "soda" (typical, open-aired local restaurant) daily for lunch and dinner. Nosara (the town containing Playa Guiones) is quite built-up; much of the food and accommodation was surprisingly expensive. The soda offered a wholesome place to eat for relatively cheap. Their carne en salsa quickly became a favorite. Despite my shaky Spanish, I managed to befriend the Costa Rican women who ran the place.

I also made great progress on Dostoevsky's "The Brothers Karamazov". Elder Zosima's words meant little more there: "Life is paradise, and we are all in paradise, but we refuse to see it".

The trip successfully scratched my itch. At the same time, it teased me with a glimpse of a simple, pure way of life. But, for now, back to New York City.
